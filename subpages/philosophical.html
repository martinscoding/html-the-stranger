      <h1>Philosophical Analysis</h1>
      <p>
        One of the reasons <em>The Stranger</em> is such a powerful novel is because it 
        embodies Albert Camus’ philosophy of the absurd. Camus argued that life has no 
        built-in meaning. We search for purpose, but the universe remains silent. This 
        clash between our desire for meaning and the world’s indifference is what he 
        called “the absurd.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Meursault, the main character, illustrates this idea through his actions and 
        attitudes. His lack of emotion at his mother’s funeral and his indifference 
        toward love, work, and ambition disturb those around him. But Camus doesn’t 
        portray him as a monster. Instead, Meursault is honest in a way that most people 
        are not: he refuses to pretend that life has more meaning than it really does.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scene on the beach, where Meursault kills the Arab man, can be read as the 
        height of the absurd. The act is not carefully planned or driven by hatred—it 
        happens under the crushing heat of the sun, almost as if nature itself pushes him 
        to pull the trigger. It shows how fragile our sense of control really is, and how 
        quickly life can shift into chaos without reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paradoxically, Meursault’s time in prison becomes the moment when he reaches 
        clarity. Knowing that he will be executed, he understands that death is the one 
        certainty all people share. By accepting this truth, he no longer seeks comfort 
        in illusions. Instead, he learns to value life itself, brief and fragile as it is. 
        In this acceptance, Camus suggests, lies true freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
        The novel therefore challenges us as readers: if the universe is indifferent, 
        how should we live? For Camus, the answer is not despair but courage. Like 
        Meursault, we can embrace life without appeal to higher meaning, finding 
        authenticity and even joy in the face of the absurd.
