      <h1>Summary</h1>
      <p>
        Albert Camus’ novel <em>The Stranger</em>, first published in 1942, tells the story of 
        Meursault, a man who seems strangely detached from the world around him. The book 
        begins with his mother’s death, which he acknowledges with little visible emotion. 
        This reaction shocks others and immediately sets him apart as someone who does not 
        behave the way society expects.

        After the funeral, Meursault continues his ordinary life in Algiers. He starts 
        spending time with Marie, a former co-worker, and becomes involved in the problems 
        of his neighbor Raymond. One summer day, these events build up to a confrontation 
        on the beach. Overcome by the oppressive heat and blinding sunlight, Meursault 
        shoots and kills an Arab man. The act is sudden, almost as if it happens outside 
        of his own control, and it changes the course of his life.

        The second half of the novel focuses on Meursault’s trial. Rather than carefully 
        examining the murder itself, the court becomes obsessed with his character. His 
        indifference at his mother’s funeral is treated as proof that he is heartless and 
        dangerous. In the end, he is sentenced to death not only for the crime he committed, 
        but also for failing to live up to society’s expectations of grief, love, and 
        morality.

        Facing execution, Meursault finally confronts life on its own terms. He realizes 
        that the world is indifferent to human struggles and that searching for ultimate 
        meaning is pointless. Yet this realization gives him peace: if life has no higher 
        purpose, then he is free to accept it as it is. Camus uses Meursault’s story to 
        show how one can embrace the “absurd” condition of existence and still find a way 
        to live authentically.
